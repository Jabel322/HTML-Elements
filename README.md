       Money Heist 
  
   <h1>      
	Although, it's not a movie but a Netflix series, it's my favorite viewing, hands down. Money Heist is an international phenomenon that truly took the world by surprise. We can’t get enough of Money Heist’s intricately planned heists, enthralling dramatic performances, and non-stop action. Yet Money Heist’s beginning didn’t go according to plan and in its first season run, on Spanish TV, the show’s creators were certain it was going to be cancelled and that would be it. But fortunately for the rest of the world, Netflix saw potential in Money Heist and scooped it up as part of their international content. Little did they know that soon, Money Heist would be the most viewed Netflix show in six countries.
